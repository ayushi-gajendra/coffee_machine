A terminal-based coffee machine simulation that manages resources, takes payments, calculates change, and dispenses coffee ‚Äî all using Python!

---

## üîß Features

- Supports 3 drinks: `espresso`, `latte`, and `cappuccino`
- Tracks ingredients (`water`, `milk`, `coffee`) and money
- Checks resource sufficiency before making coffee
- Accepts coins: quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies
- Calculates and returns change
- Special commands:
  - `report`: prints current resource and money status
  - `off`: turns off the machine

## üß† Python Concepts Used

- **Functions**: For checking resources, processing coins, and making coffee
- **Dictionaries**: For menu and resource management
- **Control Flow**: Conditional logic, loops, boolean flags
- **Input Handling**: Accepts and validates user input
- **Global Variables**: For shared state (`profit`, `resources`)
